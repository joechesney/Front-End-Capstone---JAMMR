This is my Front End Capstone Project at Nashville Software School


# JAMMR
My goal is create a web/ mobile app called JAMMR where users can look for other musicians nearby to play with. 

1. Users can make an account using Google authentication.
2. Users can create a profile with relevant information such as: 
  i. instruments they play
  ii. What they are looking for (eg: specific other-instrument players, starting a band, certain genres, just a "jam", etc.)
  iii. Their age, location, other slightly-personal information
  iv. Whether they have a play to play loud music (like a practice space)
  v. Their skill level at their instrument
  vi. Whether they are a professional, amateur, or hobbyist
3. Users can search for other users based on any of the profile information above.
4. Users can contact each other through in-app chat system to talk to each other.
5. 


Post-MVP Goals: 
1. Users can see a map with "approximate" locations of other users online. 
2. Users can see a "feed" such as 'nearby musicians' filtered by their preferred search criteria.
3. Users can see a feed with posts from other users advertising themselves as 'currently looking to meet up literally right now'.
  i. Other users would get a push notification of these posts and would be able to directly contact the user who posted.
