This is my Front End Capstone Project at Nashville Software School


# JAMMR
My goal is create a web/ mobile app called JAMMR where users can look for other musicians nearby to play with. 

1. Users can make an account using Google authentication.
2. Users can create a profile with relevant information such as: 
  i. instruments they play
  ii. What they are looking for (eg: specific other-instrument players, starting a band, certain genres, just a "jam", etc.)
  iii. Their age, location, other slightly-personal information
  iv. Whether they have a play to play loud music (like a practice space)
  v. Their skill level at their instrument
  vi. Whether they are a professional, amateur, or hobbyist
3. Users can search for other users based on any of the profile information above.
4. Users can contact each other through in-app chat system to talk to each other.
5. 


Post-MVP Goals: 
1. Users can see a map with "approximate" locations of other users online. 
2. Users can see a "feed" such as 'nearby musicians' filtered by their preferred search criteria.
3. Users can see a feed with posts from other users advertising themselves as 'currently looking to meet up literally right now'.
  i. Other users would get a push notification of these posts and would be able to directly contact the user who posted.
4. An open chat room where people can post anything they want to.
  i. ideally, this would only be implemented for an "area", and users would have to subscribe to an "area", which would be the city they live in. That way I could filter the messages they see, based on which area they are in.
5. Possibly enable Reachability, to indicate to users, whether other users are currently online.
